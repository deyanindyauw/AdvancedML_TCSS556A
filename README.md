Here is a comparison of existing Graph Neural Network libraries available in the following Python frameworks - Keras, Tensor Flow and PyTorch.
We performed the task of Node Classification on Cora dataset which is a citation network of authors and their publications.
Following notebooks are used :
1. Keras_GNN(custom)_Cora_NodeClassification
2. PyTorchGeometric_GNN_Cora_NodeClassification
